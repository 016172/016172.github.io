            <img src="billy-sullivan.jpg" >
          
            <p>Billy Sullivan In a fitting tribute on the occasion of the New England Patriots 50th anniversary celebration in 2009, Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft inducted the franchise’s original owner, Billy Sullivan, into the Patriots Hall of Fame as a contributor. Sullivan is the first contributor to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Sullivan and a consortium of businessmen mustered up enough cash in 1959 to secure the eighth and final AFL franchise in a new league that would attempt to do what many had tried and failed to do before them -- battle the established NFL. Dubbed “The Foolish Club”, the original eight AFL owners persevered and succeeded. The two league’s merged in 1970. Sullivan owned the club until 1988 when he sold to razor magnate Victor Kiam. But while professional football in New England had failed to take root in previous attempts, Sullivan’s effort laid the groundwork for today’s Patriots. Under Sullivan, the 1963 Patriots played for the AFL Championship. He also oversaw NFL playoff teams in 1976, 1978, 1982, 1985 and 1986 with an AFC Championship and Super Bowl berth in 1985.</p>

            <h4>Gil Santos</h4>
            <img src="Gilsantos.jpeg">
         
            <p>Gil Santos was the voice of the Patriots for 36 seasons - touching five decades. The venerable Santos called 743 career Patriot games and earned the moniker “Voice of the New England Patriots.” Patriots owner and CEO Robert Kraft surprised Santos with the announcement that the legendary radio broadcaster would become the 20th person to be inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame and just the second non-player to earn the honor as a contributor for his off-field contributions to the team. It is the highest honor the team can bestow an individual. Santos began calling games for the Boston Patriots at Fenway Park in 1966. For the first five seasons, he provided color analysis alongside veteran play-by-play man Bob Starr. When the team moved to Foxborough in 1971, Santos moved into his current role as play-by-play voice of the Patriots (1971-79). WBZ lost the Patriots radio rights in the 1980s, but got them back in 1991 at which time it returned Santos to his natural position as Voice of the New England Patriots, a position he held for the 22 more seasons until his retirement following the 2012 season. The veteran play-by-play broadcaster was also the sports director of WBZ News Radio in Boston, where he earned dozens of awards and honors for his reporting, sportscasting and play-by-play excellence. He retired from WBZ after 38 years in 2009 and was inducted into the Massachusetts Broadcasters Hall of Fame that year. In addition to his work at WBZ, the skilled play-by-play broadcaster also called basketball games for the Boston Celtics and Providence Friars, as well as football games for the Penn State Nittany Lions, Boston College Eagles, Brown Bears and Boston Breakers of the USFL. Inducted 2013.</p>

             <p>John Hannah played his entire career with the Patriots from 1973 through the 1985 Super Bowl season and was dubbed "The Greatest Offensive Lineman of All Time" by Sports Illustrated. A durable player at a physical position, Hannah played in 183 games and missed only five games due to injury. He was one of only two Patriots voted to the NFL’s 75th anniversary team. The nine-time Pro Bowler earned Offensive Lineman of the Year honors for four straight years (1978-81). He anchored the 1978 offensive line that set an NFL record with 3,165 rushing yards - a record which has not been challenged since. In 1991, Hannah was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and was the initial member of the Patriots Hall of Fame. In 1999, Hannah was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame for his outstanding career at the University of Alabama under coach Bear Bryant. Hannah is still active with the Patriots organization even while making his home in Alabama. Inducted 1991.</p>

In 1970, Buoniconti was named to the All-AFL Team commemorating the best players in that league’s history. Hall of Fame quarterback Len Dawson said of Buoniconti, "If you are lucky enough to knock him down, you have to lay on him or he'll get right back into the play." In 1992, Buoniconti was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame and in 2001, he was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

             <p>Gino Cappelletti is the “original Patriot” and perhaps the most recognized figure in franchise history. A versatile player, Cappelletti played wide receiver and kicker for the Patriots from 1960-70 and was the Patriots all-time leading scorer until 2005 when he was surpassed by Adam Vinatieri. He led the American Football League in scoring five times and holds two of the top five scoring seasons in league history – 147 points in 1961 and 155 points in 1964, a season in which he named the AFL’s Most Valuable Player. Cappelletti was voted an AFL All-Star five times and still holds the Patriots records for career field goals made. He also remains among the top 10 receivers in Patriots history. After his playing career ended, Cappelletti moved into the broadcast booth with his longtime partner Gil Santos. For the better part of the past quarter century, Santos and Cappelletti have been the voices of the Patriots for millions of New England football fans. In 1992,Cappelletti was inducted in the Patriots Hall of Fame. The Minnesota native makes his home in Massachusetts. Inducted 1992.</p>

             <p>Bob Dee was the Ironman of the American Football League, never missing a game during his career. A local product, Dee was born in Quincy, Mass., and graduated from the College of Holy Cross. As a defensive lineman for the Patriots from 1960 to 1967, Dee started 112 consecutive games, wearing the same helmet nearly every game. He scored the first touchdown in AFL history when he dove onto a fumble in the end zone in a preseason contest vs. Buffalo. Dee was voted to five AFL All-Star teams and was enshrined in the Patriots Hall of Fame in 1993.</p>

Fullback Jim Nance posthumously earned the honor of becoming the 14th player and the first running back to be inducted into the team’s Hall of Fame. Nance played seven season with the Patriots from 1965-1971 and was the AFL’s MVP in 1966 when he rushed for 1,458 yards and 11 touchdowns. He also was the first AFL back to eclipse the 1,000-yard rushing mark in consecutive seasons. His 104.1 rushing yards per game in 1966 remains a Patriots record. His 45 rushing TDs is tops in team history while his 5,323 rushing yards is second to Sam Cunningham. Nance was named to the Patriots All-Time Team in 2009. Inducted 2009.</p>

             <p>Sam Cunningham played nine season for the Patriots, appearing in 107 games from 1973-1979 and 1981-1982. He is the Patriots all-time leading rusher with 5,453 yards and his 43 rushing touchdowns rank second in team history. He played a significant role in helping the Patriots set the NFL record for most rushing yards in a season with 3,165 yards in 1978. Cunningham joined the Patriots as a 1973 first round draft pick after an All American career at USC. He was dubbed Sam “Bam” Cunningham while in college for his ability to dive over piles into the end zone. He is a member of the Patriots 50th Anniversary Team and 1970s All-Decade Team. He was enshrined to the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2010. He lives in California.</p>

             <p>Jon Morris played 11 seasons for the Patriots, appearing in 130 games from 1964-74. He earned seven consecutive All-Star appearances with six AFL-All Star games (1964 through 1969) and was an AFC Pro Bowl center in 1970. His seven league All-Star selections rank second in Patriots history behind Pro Football Hall of Famer John Hannah (9). Morris was the first Patriots’ player to be selected to the NFL Pro Bowl. Morris anchored an offensive line that opened holes for Jim Nance to amass a team-record 45 rushing touchdowns from 1965-71. He was selected by the Patriots in the fourth round of the 1964 American Football League Draft out of Holy Cross. He was also selected in the second round by Vince Lombardi of the Green Bay Packers but chose to go to the AFL and the Patriots. After his playing career, Morris worked as the color commentator on Patriots radio broadcasts from 1979 to 1987, followed by color analysis of NFL games for NBC television. Morris also played for Detroit (1975-77) and Chicago (1978). Inducted 2011.</p>

            <img src="DrewBledsoe.jpg">
            
             <p>Drew Bledsoe was the first overall pick in the 1993 NFL Draft and for the next eight years was considered the face of the Patriots franchise. During his nine-year Patriots career, he broke the Patriots’ career passing records for attempts (4,518), completions (2,544) and yards (29,657). Bledsoe still holds the Patriots’ single-season passing records for attempts (691) and completions (400) and is the only player in franchise history to pass for over 400 yards multiple times (4). He still holds the NFL record for attempts in a season (691 in 1994) and both attempts (70) and completions (45) in a game against Minnesota in 1994 that sparked a seven-game win streak, propelling the Patriots to their first playoff berth in eight years. Bledsoe led the Patriots to the playoffs four times in his first six seasons, helping the team earn back-to-back division titles and three consecutive playoff berths for the first time in franchise history. In 1996, he guided the Patriots to their second AFC Championship in franchise history and a trip to Super Bowl XXXI. Bledsoe is the only quarterback in NFL history with four seasons of at least 600 pass attempts, including three straight from 1994-96 with the Patriots. Inducted 2011.</p>

             <p>Troy Brown spent his entire 15-year career with the Patriots (1993-2007) after being drafted by the team in the eighth round (198th overall) in the 1993 NFL Draft. The 5-foot-10 inch, 196-pound receiver, punt returner and defensive back retired as the team’s all-time leading receiver with 557 career receptions and as the team’s all-time leading punt returner with 252 career returns. He finished ranked second in Patriots history with 6,366 career receiving yards and was tied for the franchise record with three punt returns for touchdowns. Brown played in 192 games, placing him fourth on the team’s all-time games played list and his 15 seasons with the franchise tied Julius Adams for the second-longest tenure in a Patriots uniform behind Steve Grogan’s 16 seasons. Brown helped the Patriots to three Super Bowl championships and went to his only Pro Bowl in 2001. In 2004, he added defense to his resume when he began playing defensive back and finished second on the team with three interceptions. His ability to make sizable contributions on offense, defense and special teams as well as his ability to perform in the clutch made him one of the most versatile and valuable players in team history. Inducted 2012.</p>

            <h4>Tedy Bruschi</h4>
            <img src="TedyBruschi.jpg">
            
             <p>Tedy Bruschi was the consummate Patriot during his 13 seasons in New England – so much so that Bill Belichick called him the "perfect player" at Bruschi’s retirement press conference in 2009. Bruschi was a seven-time team captain whose relentless work ethic, on-field intensity and full-tilt-full-time approach set the tone for his team while making him a fan favorite in New England. Bruschi was originally drafted by the Patriots in the third round of the 1996 NFL Draft. He played in his first of five Super Bowls that season and is one of a select few Patriots to own three World Championship rings. In his 13 seasons, Bruschi helped propel the Patriots to 11 winning records, nine playoff appearances, including eight as division championships, five conference crowns and those three Super Bowl titles. In 211 career games (including regular-season and playoffs), the Patriots had a 144-67 (.682) record, including a 16-6 (.727) playoff mark. Bruschi earned his first Pro Bowl honor following the 2004 season after co-captaining a Patriots defense that allowed just 16.25 points per game, the third fewest in franchise history. Bruschi had a knack for making big plays in critical situations. He is the only player in NFL history to return four consecutive interceptions for touchdowns and his career total of four picks returned for scores ranks second in Patriots history. After Bruschi suffered a stroke in February 2005, he established “Tedy’s Team,” which is dedicated to raising funds and awareness to fight stroke along with the American Stroke Association. Inducted 2013.</p>

             <p>Ty Law spent 10 seasons with the Patriots (1995-2004) after joining the team as a first-round (23rd overall) draft pick out of Michigan in 1995. Law was a three-time Super Bowl Champion (XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX), a four-time Pro Bowl player (1998, 2001, 2002, 2003) and a two-time All-Pro (1998, 2003) during his tenure with the Patriots. Law tied Raymond Clayborn's career franchise-record with 36 interceptions and finished with the most interception-return yards in team history with 583. His six interceptions returned for touchdowns are also a franchise best. Law had nine interceptions in 1998 to become the first Patriots player to lead the NFL in that category. He was a playmaker who played some of his best games in the postseason. He helped lead the Patriots to their first Super Bowl title in 2001 when he intercepted a Kurt Warner pass against the Rams and returned it 47 yards for a touchdown for the first points of the game. In the 2003 AFC Championship Game, Law intercepted three Peyton Manning passes while leading the Patriots to a 24-14 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. Law was part of a record-breaking Patriots defense in 2003 that led the NFL in five key categories: opponents points per game (14.9), interceptions (29), fewest touchdown receptions allowed (11), opponent's passer rating (56.2) and pass deflections (121) as the team captured its second Super Bowl title in a win over the Carolina Panthers. Law is a member of the NFL's all-decade team for the 2000s as well as the Patriots' all-1990s and all-2000s decade teams. He was also selected to the Patriots' 50th Anniversary Team. He was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2014.</p>

He led the Patriots in sacks in three consecutive seasons from 1967-69 and his 39 career sacks are tied for 10th (with Richard Seymour) on the Patriots all-time career sacks list. Antwine earned six consecutive American Football League (AFL) All-Star selections from 1963-68. His six all-star appearances are tied for the fourth highest total in franchise history. He was acquired in a trade from the Houston Oilers in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 1962 AFL Draft on April 1, 1961. He is a member of the Patriots 50th Anniversary Team and a member of the 1960s All-Decade Team.</p>

             <p>Willie McGinest was the fourth overall selection in the first round of the 1994 NFL Draft out of Southern California. He played 12 of his 15 NFL seasons with the Patriots and was one of the cornerstones of the team’s success during Super Bowl championships in 2001, 2003 and 2004. He ranks third in team history with 78 sacks and led the team in sacks six times, including a career high 11 in 1995. McGinest’s 16 postseason sacks is an NFL record and he set the NFL mark for most sacks in a postseason game with 4 1/2 in a 2005 Wild Card win vs. Jacksonville. One of his most memorable plays came in a 2003 regular-season game when he stuffed Indianapolis running back Edgerrin James on the goal line with 11 seconds remaining to preserve a 38-34 win. He was a versatile player, who played defensive end and linebacker and earned Pro Bowl honors in 1996 and 2003. He helped the Patriots post nine winning seasons in 12 years, and led the team to six division titles, four conference championships and three Super Bowl championships during his career.</p>
