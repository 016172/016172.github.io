<p>Malcolm Terel Butler (born March 2, 1990) is an American football cornerback for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). Butler is responsible for one of the most famous plays in NFL history, an interception at the goal line with 20 seconds left in Super Bowl XLIX. The play prevented a go ahead touchdown by the Seattle Seahawks and put the Patriots in position to win the Super Bowl. Butler was also on the Patriots team that won Super Bowl LI over the Atlanta Falcons.

Butler was an undrafted free agent who played collegiate football at the University of West Alabama. During his senior year in 2013, Butler broke up 18 passes and had two interceptions and was named first team All-Gulf South Conference at cornerback.	</p>

<p>Butler was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and has four siblings. He graduated from Vicksburg High School in 2009. As a senior, he averaged five tackles per game. Despite only playing football in his freshman and senior years at the high school, Butler earned a scholarship to Hinds Community College in Raymond, Mississippi. Butler also participated in track & field at Vicksburg, where he competed in sprints and jumps. He had personal-bests of 12.07 seconds in the 100-meter dash, 1.83 meters (6'0") in the high jump, and 6.92 meters (22'8.5") in the long jump.	</p>

<p>In his 2009 freshman year at Hinds Community College, Butler recorded 22 tackles and one interception, but was kicked off the team after the fifth game of the season.[4] He transferred to Alcorn State University before being invited back to Hinds Community College in 2011, and as a sophomore recorded 43 tackles, three interceptions, and 12 broken-up passes.

In 2012, Butler enrolled at the University of West Alabama, majoring in physical education. He started all 12 games that fall for the Division II Tigers. Butler finished the 2012 season with 49 tackles, 43 solo, five interceptions (including three in one game against West Georgia), and averaged a team-leading 29.8 yards per kickoff return. In 2013, he was named a Beyond Sports Network All-American after recording 45 tackles, two interceptions, and one blocked field goal, and averaging 27.9 yards on kickoff returns during the season.	</p>

<p>In the season opener against the Arizona Cardinals on September 11, Butler broke up a potential touchdown pass to Michael Floyd in the fourth quarter. In Week 7, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he notched his first interception, picking off a pass from backup quarterback Landry Jones intended for wide receiver Antonio Brown. In Week 11, against the San Francisco 49ers, Butler recorded his first career NFL sack against Colin Kaepernick. In Week 13, against the Los Angeles Rams, Butler intercepted rookie quarterback Jared Goff for his second interception of the season. Against the New York Jets in Week 16 on Christmas Eve, Butler had the first multi-interception game of his career: he picked off both Bryce Petty and Ryan Fitzpatrick and also recovered a fumble. Butler was named second-team All-Pro by Pro Football Focus and the Associated Press. He won his second Super Bowl when the Patriots won Super Bowl LI against the Atlanta Falcons in overtime by a score of 34-28.	</p>
